Regular Expression - Confirming an Email

Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are distinct strings composed of various character sets. They serve as query tools and validators within codebases and traditional documents. Regular expression function as tools to identify patterns in text files. Despite their initially cryptic appearance, regular expressions can be broken down into manageable components, revealing that they are not as intricate as they may seem to beginners.  expressions.

## Summary

This tutorial will be covering the regex expression used for both matching and cofirming an email: 

^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$

The provided regular expression can also be applied as a text sequence in a code repository to validate and match an email address. This technique ensures that users cannot proceed in situations where valid email addresses are required for form completion. By incorporating the regex sequence, users are compelled to enter an unspecified count of characters, succeeded by an "@" symbol, followed by a domain name of unspecified length. Additionally, the domain name system (for example, ".com," ".net," ".dev," etc.) must have a length between 2 and 6 characters as demonstrated in this instance.

## Regex Components
The building blocks of this specific expression include anchor points, quantifiers, meta escape characters, character classes, individual character matches, grouping and capturing, as well as bracket expressions.
Based on the provided tutorial example, the anchor points "^" and "$" are employed. Quantifiers such as "+" and "{2, 6}" are used. The meta escape character "\d" is utilized. Character classes are represented by "[a-z0-9_.-]," "[\da-z.-]," and "[a-z.]." Individual character matches are symbolized by "_," ".," and "-." Grouping and capturing are denoted by "()" and the bracket expression is illustrated by "[]."

### Anchors
Anchors within regex mark the start and end points of the expression. In regards to this expression, the ^ marks the start of the expression and the $ marks the end of the expression.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers in regex are symbols or meta-characters that indicate the number of times a preceding element should be matched. They allow you to specify how many occurrences of a particular character or group of characters are required in the input string for a match to occur. 

-  + after [a-z0-9_\.-]: This quantifier matches one or more occurrences of any lowercase letter, digit, underscore, dot, or hyphen.

-  + after ([\da-z\.-]+): This quantifier matches one or more occurrences of any digit, lowercase letter, dot, or hyphen within the group.

{-  2,6} after [a-z\.]: This quantifier specifies that the character class [a-z\.] should repeat between 2 and 6 times. This is used for the domain name system (e.g., ".com," ".net," ".dev").
