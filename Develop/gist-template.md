Regular Expression - Confirming an Email

Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are distinct strings composed of various character sets. They serve as query tools and validators within codebases and traditional documents. Regular expression function as tools to identify patterns in text files. Despite their initially cryptic appearance, regular expressions can be broken down into manageable components, revealing that they are not as intricate as they may seem to beginners.  expressions.

## Summary

This tutorial will be covering the regex expression used for both matching and cofirming an email: 

^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$

The provided regular expression can also be applied as a text sequence in a code repository to validate and match an email address. This technique ensures that users cannot proceed in situations where valid email addresses are required for form completion. By incorporating the regex sequence, users are compelled to enter an unspecified count of characters, succeeded by an "@" symbol, followed by a domain name of unspecified length. Additionally, the domain name system (for example, ".com," ".net," ".dev," etc.) must have a length between 2 and 6 characters as demonstrated in this instance.
